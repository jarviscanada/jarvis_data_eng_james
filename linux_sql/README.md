## Introduction
The Cluster Monitoring Solution is used to collect the hardware specifications of each node and monitor node resources usages. The data will be collected and stored in a RDBMS database. The report generated by these data will be use for future resource planning purpose.

## Architecture and Design
1)Cluster Diagram:
![my image](./assets/diagram.png)
2)Tables
  All tables are created under `host_agent` database
  - `host_info`  table contains hardware specifications data.
  - `host_usage` table contains server CPU and memory usage data.
3)Scripts
  - `host_info.sh`  collect hardware specifications data and store it in `host_info` table.
  - `host_usage.sh` collect server CPU and memory usage data and store it in `host_usage` table. The script will be called periodically using scheduler.

## Usage
1) how to init database and tables (e.g. ddl.sql)
2) `host_info.sh` usage
3) `host_usage.sh` usage
4) crontab setup

## Improvements
Write at least three things you want to improve
e.g.
1) handle hardware update
