# James Li . Jarvis Consulting

If I had to describe myself succinctly, I would say that I am a detail-oriented, responsible, and committed engineer, with a get-it-done, on-time, and as best as possible spirit. I am team-oriented, teachable, and a recent graduate from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am also a skilled Java Developer with experience creating Java application and I have the ability to implement and manage SQL database operations and data structures. On a more personal note, I enjoy traveling and playing outdoor sports such as golfing and snowboarding. In summary, I am looking for an opportunity to use my experiences and skills within the data engineering industry.

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_james](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_james)


- **[Cluster Monitor](./linux_sql)**: Implemented a Cluster Monitoring Solution using Bash to collect the hardware specifications of each node and monitor node resource usages. The data will be collected and stored to a PostgreSQL server which runs inside a docker container.
- **[Core Java Apps](./core_java)**: This project consists of three-part
    - Developed a text search application using Java. The application can search for a text pattern recursively in a given directory, and output matched lines to a file.
    - Implemented is a data processing application which allows user to connect to the PostgreSQL database and perform actions to the tables. The application implements CRUD functionality with JDBC APIs, which allow users to create, read, update, and delete in PostgreSQL RDBMS.
    - Designed a command-line application that allows users to Create, Read, and Delete Tweets. It connects to Twitter REST API using the authentication tool OAuth and performs part of CRUD implementation. Post and Get request was used, and the returned tweets were processed using DAO design pattern.
- **[SpringBoot App](./springboot)**: Programmed a REST API designed for online stock trading simulation. The application allows a trader to sell and buy stock. The application gathers market information from an online data source IEX cloud, and stores this information along with user information in a PostgresSQL database. Dependency management is done using SpringBoot and Maven.
- **[Hadoop](./hadoop)**: Implemented a data analysis project performed using Spark through Zeppelin Notebook. World Development Indicator data was used to perform the analysis focused on Annual GDP Growth. The Hadoop cluster was hosted on Google Cloud.
- **[Spark/Scala](./spark)**:  In-Progress
- **[Cloud & DevOps](./cloud_devops)**: Not started
