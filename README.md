# James Li . Jarvis Consulting

If I had to describe myself succinctly, I would say that I am a detail-oriented, responsible, and committed engineer, with a get-it-done, on-time, and as best as possible spirit. I am team-oriented, teachable, and a recent graduate from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am also a skilled Java Developer with experience creating Java application and I have the ability to implement and manage SQL database operations and data structures.
